Notes on religious transmission #1
====

-----------

A recurrent pattern that I see in individual runs in which there
appears to be selection for spirituality, is that if you run it long
enough, the mean becomes less spiritual, while the variance still
remains moderate.

-----------

In theory:

Copying spiritual neighbors potentially benefits you, and them.

Copying non-spiritual neighbors potentially hurts you, and them.

In a pest region in which only some are spiritual, no one benefits from
the spiritual, since the non-spiritual will be noisy.
Well that's not quite right.  If you are noisy, and no one else around
you is, then they benefit from their non-noisy neighbors, with whom
they coordinate fallow periods.  You keep communicating pests with
your immediate neighbors.  And if the pests move fast enough, they can
get to your not-immediate-neighbors during their non-fallow periods.

So the only reliable way for spirituality to benefit you, is if your
neighbors do it, too.

Copying spirituality from pestneighbors is problematic.  Because if
you are noisy, their harvest is not good, so they have no benefit to
being spiritual.

This is a possible explanation for the erratic results that I've been
getting with individual-level spiritual copying.

A pest region that is spiritual should have lower pest loss than one
that is not.

That suggests that spirituality has to be copied en masse by
pest region groups.

Also, a watershed (including multiple pest regions) that is spiritual
will do better than a watershed that is not, since the overall water
coordination is affected by noise.

No: That's not quite right.  It's misleading.  Waterstress is likely to
be better on average when there is noise--or no worse, on average--since
coordination of fallow periods tends to increase waterstress.  More
random cropping patterns is generally good for waterstress.  So if there
is one pest region that is noisy, while the others in the watershed are
not, that is likely to be good, on average, for all of the pest regions.
However, the noisy pest region will suffer from more pestloss than the
other pest regions.  So the negative effect of noise is specific to the
noisy pest region.  That might contribute to a lower average harvest in
the entire watershed, although that might be ameliorated by lower
waterstress.  So: The negative effect of within-pest-region noise
affects the overall harvest of a watershed only via aggregating the
effect; there is no emergent negative effect of noise on a watershed.

However, it remains the case that in theory, spirituality tends to
help pest regions as a whole, roughly, and likewise for lack of
spirituality in some members of a pest region.

So again, this suggests that spirituality has to be copied en masse by
pest region groups.  One way to implement this would be to do it at
the level of temple/masceti groups.  These do not split pestregions
except in the case of the large pest region in the lower left.  Some
masceti groups include several small pest regions.  Maybe I should
allow spiritual transmission only at the masceti level?  Which I
suppose makes some sense.

If you also allow within-masceti variation and transmission of
spiritual values, then it may be that you need some homogenizing force
such as high-frequency bias or punishment.

So then what is copied from one masceti to another?  An average value?
The single value they all are required to share?  Should it be
continuous, as in my initial experiments, or Boolean, or?
Possibly make masceti into a breed, and have it hold the spiritual
value, and then noise-suppression comes from the masceti's value?

Note that if I'm going to have success-biased masceti transmission,
then I have to have a harvest success value for the mascetic--maybe an
average of its members'.

I.

analogy is presumably non-linear in number of involved propositions
(since there is mutual reinforcement).

so you could potentially have an analogy that spreads piecemeal (as in
the second moderate role model), and then pretty quickly increases its
effect.

thus you could have an analogy spread via neutral tran and then suddenly
be selected for.


II.

in subak spiritual effects, what's analogous to analogy is an entire
pest region having spiritual bels.  that's when you get the mutually
reinforcing effect.

possibly there could be some kind of individual-level tran that's
neutral, and then it takes off.  and then you start copying from those
who are in the pest region where it took off due to success bias.  i.e.
while everything's in the neutral region, there is success bias, but the
effect is random.  but then randomly, you get e.g. a small pest region
where everyone has high spirituality, and then *they* do really well.
so everyone ends up gradually copying them (e.g. with global copying).

for this kind of model I would want to adopt a non-linear effect of
spirituality, which would fit with what happens, in theory, with
analogy.


III.

Note also that if the entire watershed is noisy, there is little
waterstress cost to adopting a pestregion-wide crop pattern.  i.e. in a
noisy world, the early adopters of the spiritual values get the benefit
of suppressing pest transmission, but don't have to worry about
waterstress due to inadvertently being in sync with other pestregions in
the same watershed.
