1. On the one hand, I want *success* to bias transmission of Spiritual
Peasant propositions over Spiritual Brahman propositions.  i.e. I want
the presence of SP propns to in effect activate Worldly Peasant propns
that in turn have the effect of suppressing noise, and then as a
result, the SP propns are copied more often than WP propns.

2. On the other hand, I want the *analogy* to the facts about rice
farming and subak democracy, etc. to bias transmission of Spiritual
Peasant propns.

Maybe for the main purpose I want popco to play in the Bali
simulations, the first is what I really want.

But note that if I do it that way, I have the option of *not actually
using the Worldly Peasant propositions*.  i.e. since I can
demonstrate, separately, that SP propns bias toward WP propns, and
since I'm only *arguing* that the WP propns suppress noise, one way to
do that would be just to calculate the strength of the SP propns.

------------

Or, I could have all propns--SP, SB, WP, WB--being communicated, but
then it's only the WP propns that supress noise.  So that *that*--the
fact that success bias favors the WP propns--means it will also favor
the SP propns.  Something like that.

------------

Note that in the dispersal-style simulations, the transmitted analog
is *biased* by the other, but will often fix on a less than perfect
analogy.

And this will happen more often if I allow network structure to affect
communication of spiritual propns.

So, maybe the success bias can *overcome* this effect.  That would be
cool.

------------

Re noise in the form of randomly choosing a new cropplan and/or month:

Note that a *little* bit of noise might actually be *good*.  It's like
mutation.  It allows you to explore the parameter space.  As long as the
inheritance is still pretty high, you can still get successful results,
and possibly better results.  So the fact that greed or bhutakala or
whatever messes up the system might even be *good design*.

And in fact I am seeing this result, maybe (on some runs, at least),
e.g. for bhutakala-influence = 0.01.

Note that a small noise probability can have a big effect, since you run
it on all 172 subaks, and what's beneficial is coordination within
pest-regions.  Also, you get two choices per subak: crop plan, and
month.

Not sure that random choice is really completely realistic, since real
greed/bhutakala/etc. would be more systematic.  It's not *really* like
random mutation.
