doc
====

Documents about the project as a whole go here.  Some documentation on
individual components and source files should instead be put in
subdirectories of src.

(Marshall has a lot of other notes, mostly not directly related to
implementation of the models, in his ~/papers/Bali,
~/papers/APAdoingPhilWithComputers, and maybe ~/phil/culture.  That
material is not part of this git repo.)
