What is the effect of success bias compared to analogy bias?

Here are two ways to test what success bias contributes on top of
analogy bias in two ways:

1. In popco alone, see what effect simple success bias (e.g. as a
   function of per-person/subak mean activation of spiritual-peasant
   propositions) has on the distribution (and perhaps paths) of run mean
   activations.

2. In NetLogo-popco, see what effect NetLogo success bias (e.g. as a
   crop yield) has on the distribution (and perhaps paths) of run mean
   activations.


A separate (and maybe more interesting) question is this:  What does
analogy bias contribute in addition to success bias?

The general answer should be that it fosters certain non-random patterns
on which selection can act.  I'd argue that this is useful, in general,
since these will be patterns that have a greater chance of matching
world patterns.  Analogy is a heuristic for coadaptation of beliefs
that is continuous with other methods of generalization.

Here are ways to experiment for this question:

1. In popco alone, see what effect adding analogy has on simple
   success bias.  Hypothesis: Without analogy, success bias on SP
   propositions will have a harder time getting started, and will take
   longer to get where it's going.  And the distribution of end states
   might be broader.

2. Can I do an analogous test using NetLogo-popco?  Yes, why not?

Note that there's a little bit of artificiality here, since I'm assuming
that the collection of spiritual-peasant propositions facilitates
noise-supression, and therefore success.
