Simulations building on ideas from Lansing and Kremer's simulations of
Balinese irrigation water management--starting from Marco Janssen's
NetLogo implementation (see below).  For example, I've added a separate
channel of cultural transmission that represents the spread of religious
influences in Balinese farming.
