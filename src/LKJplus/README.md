Janssen's Lansing-Kremer Bali simulation
========================================

This directory contains a modified version Marshall Abrams'
bugfix+enhancements version of [Marco Janssen's NetLogo
model](http://www.openabm.org/model/2221/version/2) of the
Lansing-Kremer Balinese irrigation simulation.  This is a modified
version of the model in src/LKJwithBugfixesEnhancements; the latter is a
revision of Janssen's model with bugfixes and UI enhancements, but
simulations are intended to do no more and no less than what Janssen's
model did or was intended to do.  See the README.md in that directory
for more information.  The version in *this* directory adds
functionality.  More info to come, here.  (If you'd like more info
immediately, please contact me.)
