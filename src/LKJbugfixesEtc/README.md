Janssen's Lansing-Kremer Bali simulation
========================================

This directory contains a version [Marco Janssen's NetLogo
model](http://www.openabm.org/model/2221/version/2) of the
Lansing-Kremer Balinese irrigation simulation, with modifications by
Marshall Abrams.

See ../../doc/VersionDiffs.md for a list of differences between this
version and Janssen's version 2 model from 2012.

This version should be maintained in such a way that it's able to
reproduce the original behavior with appropriate settings, but will be
more convenient, have more comments, may have some reformatted code,
etc., and may have additional options for experimentation.
