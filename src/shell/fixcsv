# Notes:
# In NetLogo, we convert the NetLogo bin lists to a string containing a bin list in csv format.
# In the csv file, the quotation mark from the string is quoted with two double quotes, 
# resulting in three double-quotes in a row.  By stripping them out, we get regular csv columns
# (since numbers don't need to be quoted).
